# tcp-like-protocol

"This project focused on the programming and implementation of a TCP-like network protocol. The protocol makes use of multiple algorithms and strategies utilized in TCP such as: 3-way handshakes for connection establishment, ordered data transfer using SYNs and ACKs, ACK-signaled retransmission, timeout-based retransmission, Sliding Window flow control, slow start, congestion avoidance using a Congestion Window, fast-retransmit, fast-recovery, retransmission timeout using weighted RTT, and 4-way handshakes for connection termination. 

This project was developed under the instruction of Balajee Vamanan, for the Intro. to Networking (CS 450) course in the University of Illinois-Chicago."
